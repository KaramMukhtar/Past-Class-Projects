# Past-Projects
This repository houses a number of miscellaneous class projects that I completed individually. All projects listed in this repository were awarded full marks. The project files inside the repository are divided by the name of the course to which they belong, further delineation of the language used in the project can be found inside the parantheses, i.e. CS61a (Python).
