The scores and violation information have been made available by the San Francisco Department of Public Health. The main goal for this assignment is to understand how restaurants are scored.

    "### Question 4b\n",
    "\n",
    "In question 4a, we counted the number of null values per ZIP code. Reminder: we still only use the zip codes found in `sf_dense_zip`. Let's now count the proportion of null values of longitudinal coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new dataframe of counts of the null and proportion of null values, storing the result in `fraction_missing_df`. It should have an index called `postal_code_5` and should also have 3 columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `count null`: The number of missing values for the zip code.\n",
    "2. `count non null`: The number of present values for the zip code.\n",
    "3. `fraction null`: The fraction of values that are null for the zip code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your data frame should be sorted by the fraction null in descending order. The first two rows of your answer should include postal code 94107 and 94124.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommended approach: Build three series with the appropriate names and data and then combine them into a dataframe. This will require some new syntax you may not have seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "To pursue this recommended approach, you might find these two functions useful and you aren't required to use these two:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `rename`: Renames the values of a series.\n",
    "* `pd.concat`: Can be used to combine a list of Series into a dataframe. Example: `pd.concat([s1, s2, s3], axis=1)` will combine series 1, 2, and 3 into a dataframe. Be careful about `axis=1`. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint*: You can use the divison operator to compute the ratio of two series.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint*: The `~` operator can invert a boolean array. Or alternately, the `notnull` method can be used to create a boolean array from a series.\n",
    "\n",

There does appear to be a few gaps in the graph, some scores seem to have not been assigned to any of the resturants or to very few ones, most of the gaps appear to be concentrated between 90 - 100 scores. In a graph which has an overall positive, exponential curve shape where the counts increase as scores increase these values appear to be anamolies."

    "Let's figure out which restaurants had the worst scores ever (single lowest score). Let's start by creating a new dataframe called `ins_named`. It should be exactly the same as `ins`, except that it should have the name and address of every business, as determined by the `bus` dataframe. If a `business_id` in `ins` does not exist in `bus`, the name and address should be given as NaN.\n",

    "*Hint*: Use the merge method to join the `ins` dataframe with the appropriate portion of the `bus` dataframe. See the official [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/merging.html) on how to use `merge`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note*: For quick reference, a pandas 'left' join keeps the keys from the left frame, so if ins is the left frame, all the keys from ins are kept and if a set of these keys don't have matches in the other frame, the columns from the other frame for these \"unmatched\" key rows contains NaNs.\n",

    "\n",
    "Another way to compare the scores from the two inspections is to examine the difference in scores. Subtract the first score from the second in `scores_pairs_by_business`. Make a histogram of these differences in the scores. We might expect these differences to be positive, indicating an improvement from the first to the second inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The histogram should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"q7d.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint*: Use `second_score` and `first_score` created in the scatter plot code above.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint*: Convert the scores into numpy arrays to make them easier to deal with.\n",

    "*Hint*: Use `plt.hist()` Try changing the number of bins when you call `plt.hist()`.\n",
